<!-- A Fortune Teller Quiz
Similar to the project above, include a series of questions that instruct users to "Check all that apply".
Then, based on how many answers the users selected in each of several 'categories', provide them customized results.
For instance, you could prompt users to select each of the stereotypically "unlucky" events that have occurred to them in the last month ("Seeing a black cat", "Walking under a ladder", "Stubbing your toe", etc.), then how many "lucky" events have occurred ("Finding a four-leaf clover", "Seeing a rainbow", etc.) Then, based on this, provide them a silly fortune.
Include at least 3 possible results. -->


<!-- Better idea:
You enter a witch's potion shop and she asks you to select which ingredients will go into the brew.
Each item has a primary color property (some may have more than one)
As each is checked, color properties aggregate in js
Resulting potion/fortune is combination of two highest color properties (as in red+blue=purple)
Purple potion = mysterious (neutral)
orange = good luck (positive)
green = gross/poison (negative)
equal number of all three = brown potion (nothing happens/try again) -->
